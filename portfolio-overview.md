## Summary
Over the course of the semester, I've learned a wide array of skills that can be applied to machine learning. Not only did I learn the theory and implementation behind various machine learning models, but also utilizing these models to best fit a deep learning, classification, or neural network application. Before this class, I always had a profound interest in machine learning and I'm glad that this project based class allowed me to utilize these newfound skills into practical applications. I have plans to continue what I've learned in this class through personal projects that explore generative pre-trained transformer models. Recent GPT and DALL-E models have certainly disrupted the industry and further shows the importance of keeping up with this rapidly changing field in the future. Feel free to reach out to me about possible employment opportunities!
